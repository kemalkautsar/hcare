                    <p>Raising children is expensive enough without adding high medical costs on top, which is why most
                        Australian families have private family health insurance.</p>

                    <p>As a parent you want to protect your children so they can grow up to be healthy and happy, but
                        even
                        the healthiest children can encounter regular illnesses and occasional injuries. In the event
                        that
                        you have to deal with a long-term or serious illness in the family, medical costs can quickly
                        spiral out of control.</p>

                    <p>The best family health insurance can help ease the financial burden of raising a family and give
                        you the reassurance that comes with knowing you are covered in case of the unexpected, so it's
                        important to do your research and compare the family health insurance policies that are out
                        there
                        to get the best deal possible.</p>

                        reviewed your health insurance policy, now is a good time to speak to someone about whether
                        your
                        current policy is meeting all your needs.</p>

                    <p>As you know, families change very quickly and your health insurance should grow with you. Our

                        waiting
                        periods when you transfer to a cover with equivalent benefitsâ€¦ even if you have a pre-existing

                    <h5>Why do I need a specific family health insurance policy?</h5>
                    <p>Health insurance is designed to cover you for different life stages. Before meeting your partner
                        or
                        starting a family you probably had an individual health insurance policy. You may have kept
                        this
                        when you met your partner, or you might have changed to a couple's policy where you were both
                        included.</p>

                    <p>When considering starting a family, most couples decide to switch to a family health insurance
                        policy. While you can in theory, take out a separate policy for each individual member of the
                        family, a family policy lets you combine cover for everyone.</p>

                    <p>This is more convenient and usually cheaper than taking out individual cover and because family
                        health insurance is tailored to meet the needs of people at this particular stage of their
                        lives,
                        the level and type of cover provided is usually more suited to the needs of families than a
                        generic
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>If you're expecting, it's a good idea to take out family cover early so that your baby will be
                        covered from birth. It's also important to be aware that whatever type of health insurance
                        policy
                        you have now, you will need to have obstetrics cover for at least 12 months before the birth of
                        your baby to ensure you will be covered for the birth-related hospital costs.</p>

                    <h5>Why do I need to re-evaluate my family health insurance?</h5>
                    <p>While it may seem obvious to switch from a singles or couples policy to a family one when you're
                        expecting, as your family grows it's equally important to make sure your health insurance
                        policy keeps up with your changing needs.</p>
                    <p>From baby care to early childhood development where you might need treatment like speech therapy
                        and occupational therapy, to glasses and braces for your teenager, it's important to review
                        your family's health insurance policy on a regular basis to make sure it's still appropriate
                        for you.

                        should make sure your policy does include cover for the following:</p>

                            <p>While Medicare covers children for a minimal amount of standard dental treatment each
                                year, if your child requires extensive treatment like wisdom tooth removal or
                                orthodontics (braces) you could be out of pocket by thousands of dollars.</p>

                            <h6>Glasses and contact lenses</h6>
                            <p>While eye tests are usually free on Medicare, unfortunately corrective treatment
                                including glasses and contact lenses aren't. If your child is nearsighted or farsighted
                                it can affect their ability to learn at school so it's important that issues are
                                addressed as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p>Many children experience difficulties with their speech or physical development as they
                                grow. These issues can often be corrected with the right therapy, but it's expensive
                                and not usually covered by Medicare. The right extras cover on your family health
                                insurance policy means that your child can get the help they need to get back on track
                                before they are affected over the long term.</p>

                            <p>Children invariably have accidents and illnesses that may require hospital treatment.
                                With the right hospital cover your family will be covered for some or all of the costs
                                and for long term issues you will have more affordable access to quality private
                                treatment, shorter waiting lists and your choice of health care provider.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h6>Ambulance cover</h6>
                            <p>If there is a medical emergency, you or a family member may need to get to hospital
                                quickly. Without private ambulance cover you could be left with an expensive bill to
                                pay on top of treatment costs.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Family policies are tailored to the specific needs of families, so you can get access to the
                        services you need without having to pay extra on your premium for unnecessary cover.</p>

                    <h5>How long can my children stay on my policy?</h5>
                    <p>Your children can remain on your family policy until they are 25 provided they are full-time
                        students and still your dependents. Once they stop studying full time or turn 25 they will
                        usually need to purchase their own health insurance policy.</p>

                    <p>Some health insurance policies ask you to pay a higher premium once your children are over the
                        age of 18 and not studying full-time. If this is the case for you, it may be time to review
                        your policy and look around for one that is more suited to your family's situation.</p>

                    <p>If your children have left home you will probably want to change from a family to a singles or
                        couples' insurance policy. This can help you reduce your premium costs and ensure that you're
                        covered for any medical issues you may experience in the future.</p>
