                    <p>Raising children is expensive enough without adding high medical costs on top, which is why most
                        Australian families have private family health insurance.</p>

                    <p>As a parent you want to protect your children so they can grow up to be healthy and happy, but
                        even
                        the healthiest children can encounter regular illnesses and occasional injuries. In the event
                        that
                        you have to deal with a long-term or serious illness in the family, medical costs can quickly
                        spiral out of control.</p>

                    <p>The best family health insurance can help ease the financial burden of raising a family and give
                        you the reassurance that comes with knowing you are covered in case of the unexpected, so it's
                        important to do your research and compare the family health insurance policies that are out
                        there
                        to get the best deal possible.</p>

                        reviewed your health insurance policy, now is a good time to speak to someone about whether
                        your
                        current policy is meeting all your needs.</p>

                    <p>As you know, families change very quickly and your health insurance should grow with you. Our

                        waiting
                        periods when you transfer to a cover with equivalent benefitsâ€¦ even if you have a pre-existing
