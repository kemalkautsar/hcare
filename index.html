                    <p>Raising children is expensive enough without adding high medical costs on top, which is why most
                        Australian families have private family health insurance.</p>

                    <p>As a parent you want to protect your children so they can grow up to be healthy and happy, but
                        even
                        the healthiest children can encounter regular illnesses and occasional injuries. In the event
                        that
                        you have to deal with a long-term or serious illness in the family, medical costs can quickly
                        spiral out of control.</p>

                    <p>The best family health insurance can help ease the financial burden of raising a family and give
                        you the reassurance that comes with knowing you are covered in case of the unexpected, so it's
                        important to do your research and compare the family health insurance policies that are out
                        there
                        to get the best deal possible.</p>

                        reviewed your health insurance policy, now is a good time to speak to someone about whether
                        your
                        current policy is meeting all your needs.</p>

                    <p>As you know, families change very quickly and your health insurance should grow with you. Our

                        waiting
                        periods when you transfer to a cover with equivalent benefits… even if you have a pre-existing

                    <h5>Why do I need a specific family health insurance policy?</h5>
                    <p>Health insurance is designed to cover you for different life stages. Before meeting your partner
                        or
                        starting a family you probably had an individual health insurance policy. You may have kept
                        this
                        when you met your partner, or you might have changed to a couple's policy where you were both
                        included.</p>

                    <p>When considering starting a family, most couples decide to switch to a family health insurance
                        policy. While you can in theory, take out a separate policy for each individual member of the
                        family, a family policy lets you combine cover for everyone.</p>

                    <p>This is more convenient and usually cheaper than taking out individual cover and because family
                        health insurance is tailored to meet the needs of people at this particular stage of their
                        lives,
                        the level and type of cover provided is usually more suited to the needs of families than a
                        generic
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>If you're expecting, it's a good idea to take out family cover early so that your baby will be
                        covered from birth. It's also important to be aware that whatever type of health insurance
                        policy
                        you have now, you will need to have obstetrics cover for at least 12 months before the birth of
                        your baby to ensure you will be covered for the birth-related hospital costs.</p>

                    <h5>Why do I need to re-evaluate my family health insurance?</h5>
                    <p>While it may seem obvious to switch from a singles or couples policy to a family one when you’re
                        expecting, as your family grows it’s equally important to make sure your health insurance
                        policy keeps up with your changing needs.</p>
                    <p>From baby care to early childhood development where you might need treatment like speech therapy
                        and occupational therapy, to glasses and braces for your teenager, it’s important to review
                        your family’s health insurance policy on a regular basis to make sure it’s still appropriate
                        for you.
